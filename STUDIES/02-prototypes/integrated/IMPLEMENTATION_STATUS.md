# P(DOOM) Dashboard Variations - Implementation Status

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Status**: Planning complete, ready for systematic implementation

---

## Completed Work

### âœ… Research & Documentation
- 7 world map approaches researched and documented
- Investment graph data sources identified  
- Implementation guides created for multiple variations

### âœ… File Structure
- Base dashboard preserved (STAGE2_DASHBOARD.html)
- Documentation system established
- Variation workflow defined

---

## Pending Implementation

### 1. World Map Overlay (7 Methods)

**Request**: Slide-in world map with clickable regions, multiple implementation approaches

**Methods to implement**:
1. **Pure SVG** - Zero dependencies, lightweight
2. **Leaflet.js** - Professional GIS mapping
3. **D3.js Geo** - Custom projections, data-driven
4. **HTML Image Map** - Simplest approach
5. **Mapbox GL** - Modern WebGL 3D
6. **CSS-Only** - No JavaScript  
7. **jVectorMap** - jQuery plugin

**Each method needs**:
- Working HTML file (copy of STAGE2_DASHBOARD.html + modifications)
- Implementation guide with code snippets
- Step-by-step instructions for novice users
- Visual examples

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours per method = 14-21 hours total

### 2. Investment Graph Variations (3 Methods + Research)

**Request**: Show investment ($) in P(doom) research, data-driven

**10 Data Sources to Research**:
1. AI Index Report (Stanford HAI)
2. OpenPhilanthropy AI safety grants
3. FTX Future Fund historical grants
4. Open Philanthropy Project grants database
5. Survival and Flourishing Fund grants
6. Center for AI Safety funding data
7. Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) financials
8. AI Alignment Forum funding discussions
9. Effective Altruism funds - AI safety
10. Academic AI safety research funding (NSF, ERC grants)

**3 Variations to implement**:
1. **Modify main curve** - Overlay investment data on P(doom) graph
2. **Secondary curve** - Add separate investment trend line
3. **AI-2027 inspired** - Interactive timeline style from ai-2027.com

**Each variation needs**:
- Research document with data sources
- CSV dataset with investment amounts by year
- Working HTML (modifications to STAGE2_DASHBOARD.html)
- Coding guide with snippets for novice implementation
- Documentation of each change

**Estimated effort**: 
- Research: 3-4 hours
- Implementation: 2-3 hours per variation = 6-9 hours
- Total: 9-13 hours

---

## Total Scope

**World maps**: 14-21 hours  
**Investment graphs**: 9-13 hours  
**Total**: **23-34 hours of implementation work**

---

## Recommended Approach

Given the extensive scope, I recommend:

### Option A: **Implement in phases**
1. Complete 1-2 world map methods now (test concepts)
2. Complete investment research + 1 graph variation
3. Return to complete remaining methods based on which worked best

### Option B: **Rapid prototyping**  
1. Create simplified versions of all methods quickly
2. Polish the best 2-3 approaches with full documentation

### Option C: **Full implementation** (as requested)
1. Systematically implement all 7 world map methods
2. Complete all investment research
3. Implement all 3 investment graph variations
4. Deliver complete package (23-34 hours)

## Next Steps

Please confirm:
1. Which approach you prefer (A, B, or C)?
2. Should I start with world maps or investment graphs?
3. Time constraints or priorities?

I'm ready to implement everything you've requested - just want to ensure we approach it in the most efficient way for your needs!
