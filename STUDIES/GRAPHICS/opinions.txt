Tidied description

I inspected ai-2027.com – its interactive/dynamic plots are rendered with Plotly.js, which seems ideal for live, variable graphics.

Alternative: GNUPLOT

    Good for pre‑rendered, accurate graphs.
    Can be integrated with Godot or HTML.
    Clinically precise, common in scientific work, but less visually appealing than Plotly.
    Live‑rendered versions exist; a quick web search should reveal them.

Notes on Plotly

    The AI even suggests Godot integrations for Plotly.

    I asked Plotly to generate a curve of the exponential form

    Y=Xb+c

    with sample points:
        x=2027,y=1
        x=2026,y=0.2
        x=2025,y=0.05

    Constraints: 0<y<1 (probability pDOOM).
    X is plotted from 2020 to 2030 on most graphs.

    Sliders control offset and the exponent.

    I also requested a discontinuity at y=0.5; only one graph applied it, and it was on the wrong axis.

    The math isn’t critical—this is just a proof of concept.

    Attempts to get shader‑based rendering behind the grpahs are as of yet unsuccessful.

Local HTML files (for reference)

    GRAPHICS/INTERSTING/DG.html – X‑Com‑style layout.
    GRAPHICS/INTERSTING/plotty4.html – most glitchy but visually “graph‑looking”; cool colors.
    GRAPHICS/INTERSTING/plotnasty.html – style fits the game, but the graph isn’t positioned correctly.
    GRAPHICS/INTERSTING/DOOMPLOT.html – graph placed correctly; hard to get anything but a 
    straight line—likely  needs double precision because the exponent and large X values dominate.
    GRAPHICS/INTERSTING/DJ.html – matrix output appears reliably.

Overall, this shows the platform can handle the required visualizations, though fine‑tuning is still needed.


QUESTION FOR THE AI

WHAT AI MODEL ARE YOU?
I am GPT‑OSS 120B, the model you selected from Duck.ai’s list.

Evaluation of using pdoom1.com for this project (negative opinions desired)  
Aspect Potential drawbacks  
Performance The site may rely on heavy client‑side JavaScript (e.g., Plotly) which  
    can cause lag on low‑end devices, especially with high‑resolution or double‑  
    precision calculations.  
Precision If the backend uses single‑precision floats, exponential curves with large  
    X values (2020‑2030) can lose accuracy, leading to straight‑line artifacts as you  
    observed.  
Responsiveness UI elements like sliders may not update smoothly if the rendering loop  
    isn’t throttled or if the page isn’t optimized for mobile browsers.  
Integration complexity Embedding the site’s visualizations into a Godot project may  
    require additional wrappers (e.g., WebView), increasing build size and maintenance  
    overhead.  
Styling constraints Plotly’s default themes can clash with a game’s aesthetic; overriding  
    CSS for a “game‑style” look often demands custom JavaScript, which adds to code  
    complexity.  
Documentation & Support If the site is a personal project, documentation may be sparse,  
    making it harder to troubleshoot bugs or extend functionality.  
Security Loading external scripts from an unverified domain could expose the game to  
    supply‑chain risks unless the code is audited.  
Scalability As the number of interactive plots grows, the page’s load time and memory  
    usage may become prohibitive, especially on browsers with limited resources.  

These points highlight why, despite the positive aspects you’ve noted, pdoom1.com  
might pose challenges for a production‑grade game integration.
