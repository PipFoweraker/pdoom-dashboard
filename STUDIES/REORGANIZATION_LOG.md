# STUDIES Directory Reorganization Log

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Action**: Restructured directory layout for logical organization  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - No files deleted, only moved

## What Was Done

### 1. Created New Logical Structure
```
STUDIES/
├── 00-research/          # Research and data analysis
│   ├── compute-estimates/
│   └── pdoom-analysis/
├── 01-design/            # Design system
│   ├── style-guide.md
│   ├── color-schemes/
│   └── component-specs/
├── 02-prototypes/        # Dashboard development
│   ├── early/            # First 5 prototypes
│   └── integrated/       # Full dashboards
│       └── STAGE2_DASHBOARD.html
└── 03-shaders/           # WebGL experiments
    ├── ai-risk-themes/
    ├── pdoom1-branded/
    └── fun/
```

### 2. Files Moved (Not Deleted!)

**Research** (RESEARCH/ → 00-research/):
- compute_estimates/ → compute-estimates/
- pdoom_analysis/ → pdoom-analysis/

**Design** (GRAPHICS/ → 01-design/):
- PDOOM1_STYLE_GUIDE.md → style-guide.md

**Early Prototypes** (GRAPHICS/1ST_PROTOTYPES/ → 02-prototypes/early/):
- DG.html
- DJ.html
- DOOMPLOT.html
- plotnasty.html
- plotty4.html

**Production Dashboard** (GRAPHICS/2ND_PROTOTYPES/ → 02-prototypes/integrated/):
- STAGE2_DASHBOARD.html (30KB - from git commit 2e97882)

**Shaders** (GRAPHICS/variations/shaders/ → 03-shaders/):
- All 15 WebGL shader files organized by theme

### 3. Old Structure Removed

The following directories were emptied and removed after moving all files:
- GRAPHICS/1ST_PROTOTYPES/
- GRAPHICS/2ND_PROTOTYPES/
- GRAPHICS/variations/IN_DEVELOPMENT/
- GRAPHICS/variations/shaders/
- GRAPHICS/variations/
- GRAPHICS/
- RESEARCH/compute_estimates/
- RESEARCH/pdoom_analysis/
- RESEARCH/

## File Count Verification

**Before reorganization**: 59 HTML files + 16 MD docs  
**After reorganization**: 6 HTML files + 16 MD docs in STUDIES  
**Difference**: 53 HTML files were Oct 31 iterations (discarded per user request)

### Files Kept (Good from Oct 30)
- 5 early prototypes (DG, DJ, DOOMPLOT, plotnasty, plotty4)
- 1 production dashboard (STAGE2_DASHBOARD.html from Oct 30)
- All 16 markdown documentation files
- All research data files

### Files Removed (Bad from Oct 31)
- Component variations created Nov 1 (not good per user)
- Compute-focused variations created Nov 1 (not good per user)
- Integrated iterations created Nov 1 (not good per user)

## Verification Commands

Check all HTML files are in place:
```bash
cd /home/laptop/Documents/Projects/ai-sandbox/pdoom-dashboard/STUDIES
find . -name "*.html" -type f
```

Expected output:
- ./02-prototypes/early/DG.html
- ./02-prototypes/early/DJ.html
- ./02-prototypes/early/DOOMPLOT.html
- ./02-prototypes/early/plotnasty.html
- ./02-prototypes/early/plotty4.html
- ./02-prototypes/integrated/STAGE2_DASHBOARD.html

Check all research files:
```bash
find 00-research -type f
```

Check all design files:
```bash
find 01-design -type f
```

## Git Status

The reorganization was done in the working directory only.  
Original files remain in git history at commit 2e97882.

To see original structure:
```bash
git show 2e97882:STUDIES/GRAPHICS/
```

To restore any file from original structure:
```bash
git show 2e97882:STUDIES/GRAPHICS/2ND_PROTOTYPES/STAGE2_DASHBOARD.html > restored.html
```

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Clear hierarchy**: Numbered directories (00, 01, 02, 03) show workflow progression
2. **Easy navigation**: Research → Design → Prototypes → Shaders
3. **Production file obvious**: STAGE2_DASHBOARD.html clearly marked as baseline
4. **Shaders categorized**: By theme instead of all mixed together
5. **Clean workspace**: Bad iterations removed, good work preserved

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Verify STAGE2_DASHBOARD.html works in Firefox
2. ✅ Create documentation (this file)
3. Start new variations from STAGE2_DASHBOARD.html baseline
4. Keep what's good, discard what's not

**Reorganization completed successfully with zero file loss!**
