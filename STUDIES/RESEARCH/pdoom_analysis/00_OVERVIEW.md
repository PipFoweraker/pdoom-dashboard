## Key Findings Summary

### Current Consensus (2025)
- **AI Researcher Survey Mean:** 14.4% (median: 5%)
- **Range:** 0% (Marc Andreessen) to 99.9% (Roman Yampolskiy)
- **Modal estimates:** 5-50% range represents most expert opinion

### Factors Driving Estimates
1. **Compute scaling** - Exponential growth correlates with risk increase
2. **AGI timeline** - Shorter timelines → higher P(doom)
3. **Alignment difficulty** - Perceived intractability raises estimates
4. **Coordination challenges** - Governance failures increase risk
5. **Capability surprises** - Unexpected emergent behaviors

### Major Schools of Thought
- **Optimists (0-10%):** Andreessen, LeCun, Booch — technical solutions feasible
- **Moderates (10-50%):** Hinton, Amodei, Bengio — serious but manageable risk
- **Pessimists (>50%):** Yudkowsky, Yampolskiy, Leahy — alignment fundamentally unsolved

### Temporal Trend
- **Pre-2020:** ~1-3% typical estimates
- **2020-2023:** Rise to 5-10% as GPT-3/GPT-4 demonstrated scaling
- **2023-2025:** Surge to 10-20% median as AI capabilities accelerated
- **Projection 2027:** 15-30% if current trends continue

## Methodological Challenges

1. **Definition ambiguity:** What counts as "doom"?
   - Human extinction vs. permanent disempowerment
   - Total vs. partial catastrophe

2. **Time frame uncertainty:**
   - Conditional on AGI development?
   - 10 years, 50 years, or 100+ years?

3. **Reference class problem:**
   - No historical precedent for AGI
   - Difficult to apply frequentist probability

4. **Cognitive biases:**
   - Availability heuristic (recent AI advances)
   - Anchoring on other experts' estimates
   - Motivated reasoning (career implications)

## Research Questions

1. **Correlation Analysis:** Does P(doom) track with measurable metrics?
   - Training compute scaling
   - Benchmark performance improvements
   - Investment in AI safety vs. capabilities

2. **Decomposition:** Can we break P(doom) into sub-probabilities?
   - P(AGI by year X) × P(misalignment | AGI) × P(catastrophe | misaligned AGI)

3. **Forecasting Accuracy:** How have estimates evolved?
   - Track individual researchers' predictions over time
   - Compare to prediction markets (Metaculus, Manifold)

4. **Policy Implications:** What P(doom) threshold justifies regulatory action?
   - Cost-benefit analysis of AI development pause
   - International coordination requirements
