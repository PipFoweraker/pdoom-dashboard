# Data Zones and Workflow

## Data Lake Zones

- **Raw Zone**: Stores unprocessed, original data as ingested from sources. Used for traceability and reprocessing.
- **Curated Zone**: Contains cleaned, validated, and standardized data. Ensures quality and consistency.
- **Transformed Zone**: Holds aggregated, enriched, or modeled data for analytics and reporting.
- **Metadata Zone**: Tracks data lineage, schema, quality metrics, and provenance.
- **Servable Zone**: High-quality, production-ready data exposed to the dashboard and APIs.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Ingestion**: Data is collected from sources (GitHub, Airtable, user submissions) and placed in the Raw Zone.
2. **Validation & Curation**: Data is checked for quality, cleaned, and standardized in the Curated Zone.
3. **Transformation**: Data is aggregated, enriched, or modeled in the Transformed Zone for dashboard metrics.
4. **Metadata Management**: Metadata is captured and updated for all data movements and transformations.
5. **Serving**: Data is made available via API endpoints from the Servable Zone.

## Quality Management
- Automated validation checks at each stage
- Data quality metrics tracked in Metadata Zone
- Versioning and traceability for all data

## DevOps & CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions for automated testing, validation, and deployment
- Modular, testable code and data pipelines
- Agile development practices for rapid iteration

## Extensibility
- Easily add new sources and zones
- Configurable workflow for different data types
- Scalable for future growth

## Next Steps
- Implement config stubs for zones and sources
- Build modular data loader and pipeline logic
- Document best practices for contributors
