# Best Practices for Data Lake and Dashboard Development

## Data Management Principles
- Maintain clear separation between raw, curated, transformed, metadata, and servable zones
- Automate validation and quality checks at every stage
- Track data lineage and versioning for traceability
- Use modular, testable code for data pipelines

## DevOps & CI/CD
- Use GitHub Actions for automated testing, validation, and deployment
- Keep dependencies and environment setup documented
- Use branches and pull requests for feature development
- Write tests for new features and data transformations

## Agile Development
- Build in small, testable increments
- Document changes and rationale
- Encourage collaboration and code reviews

## Extensibility
- Design for easy addition of new data sources and zones
- Use configuration files for paths and settings
- Keep code and data pipelines modular

## Contributor Guidelines
- Follow documented setup and workflow
- Add documentation for new features and data sources
- Ensure all code passes tests and validation checks
